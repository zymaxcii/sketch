For those who can't upload sketches to pro mini using the cable: You can upload the sketch via UNO. Connect UNO to your PC (using the USB cable), then connect UNO to the Pro Mini using these wires: 
UNO Tx - PRO MINI Tx, 
UNO Rx - PRO MINI Rx, 
UNO Vcc - PRO MINI Vcc, 
UNO GND - PRO MINI GND. 

 On the Arduino IDE sellect PRO MINI as the board. When you click the upload the sketch button, you must hold down the RESET button on the UNO board. Just when the Arduino IDE finishes compiling the sketch and begins the actual upload, you need to reset your PRO MINI by pressing and releasing the reset button on your PRO MINI. Remember the hold down the Reset button on your UNO during the whole process (from compiling until the upload has finished).

i just got a pro mini 5v and i only have one row of pins on the side with the button , the one in this video has  2 rows of pins on the side  with the buttons , i thought these were all supposed to  be pretty much the same but how come he has a n extra row of pins and i don"t?
also will the FTDI in the link in the description from banggood work well with windows?
